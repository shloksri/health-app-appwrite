MoodJournal

## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_


The project I created is a Mood Journal app which has 2 basic functionalities - Adding daily moods of the user, & adding journals created by the user. 

The user can log in using their Google account and write down however they are feeling on that day. The app records the date and time of their entries and the user has access to their previous records.


## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

The inspiration comes from a personal journey towards understanding mental health. In our fast-paced world, many struggle to articulate their feelings. I wanted to create a simple tool for self-reflection that allows users to log daily moods and write journals about their experiences. This practice fosters awareness and helps identify emotional patterns. Participating in the Appwrite hackathon was a great opportunity to utilize their services, ensuring the app is functional and secure while supporting personal growth and well-being.
